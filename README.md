# Optimising-Business-Data-with-SQL-Database-Manipulation
# SQL Database Optimization for Business Data
This project demonstrates how to optimize SQL queries for large business datasets to improve performance.

## Database Structure
- The dataset simulates a business with customers, products, and sales.
- Tables:
  - Customers: customer_id, name, location, etc.
  - Products: product_id, name, price, etc.
  - Sales: sale_id, customer_id, product_id, date, amount.

## Key Steps
1. Designed a normalized database schema.
2. Wrote complex SQL queries for business insights (e.g., customer segmentation, sales analysis).
3. Optimized queries using indexing, query rewriting, and partitioning.
4. Improved query performance by X%.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the database by running `database_setup.sql`.
3. Run optimized queries from `optimized_queries.sql`.
